#### Insights
1. The predictors of house price can be grouped into two: the building characteristics and the Location of the property.
2. The building area, the number of rooms and bathrooms, the type of property, the suburb, the city council and region the property is located, the year the property was built, are amongst the top predictors.
3. Date related features, such as the month of sale, the day of sale, the year of sale, do not have any effect in estimating the price of a house.
